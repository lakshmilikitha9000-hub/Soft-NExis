IoT Task 1 – Blinking LED (Arduino)

Overview:
This project demonstrates the basic setup of an IoT development environment by blinking an LED using an Arduino Uno.
It is the IoT equivalent of the “Hello, World!” program.

Description:
An Arduino Uno microcontroller is used to control an LED through GPIO pin 13.
The LED turns ON and OFF every one second, verifying correct GPIO output control.

Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- Built-in LED (Pin 13)
- Arduino IDE / Online Simulator (Wokwi or Tinkercad)
