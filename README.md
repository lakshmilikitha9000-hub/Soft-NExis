 IoT Task 1 – Blinking LED (Arduino)
 Overview:-
This project demonstrates the basic setup of an IoT development environment by blinking an LED using an Arduino Uno.
It is the IoT equivalent of the “Hello, World!” program.
Description:-
An Arduino Uno microcontroller is used to control an LED through GPIO pin 13.
The LED turns ON and OFF every one second, verifying correct GPIO output control.
Components Used:-
- Arduino Uno
- Built-in LED (Pin 13)
- Arduino IDE
  IoT Task2-Sensing the Environment
Overview:
This project demonstrates the basic concept of sensing the environment using an Arduino. An analog sensor (potentiometer or temperature sensor) is connected to the Arduino, and its output is read through an analog input pin. The Arduino converts the analog signal into a digital value using its Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and displays the sensor readings on the Serial Monitor.
The circuit and code are designed and tested using the Tinkercad online simulation platform. This task helps in understanding how IoT devices collect real-world data and process it for monitoring and control applications.
Description:
This project shows how an Arduino reads data from a sensor. An analog sensor is connected to the Arduino, and it gives a changing signal. The Arduino reads this signal using an analog pin and converts it into numbers. These numbers are then shown on the Serial Monitor. The circuit and code are done using the Tinkercad online platform. This helps us understand how IoT devices sense the environment.
Components Used:
-Arduino Uno
-Analog Sensor (Potentiometer or Temperature Sensor)
-Connecting Wires
-Tinkercad Circuits
  Circuit Connections:-
- Potentiometer left pin → 5V  
- Potentiometer middle pin → A0  
- Potentiometer right pin → GND
